# Project Overview

Oparax is an AI-powered social media automation tool for professional news reporters. It monitors X (Twitter) for breaking stories and drafts posts in the user's voice. The primary use case is a football news reporter with 400k+ followers on X.

## Project Structure

Next.js App Router app at the repo root.

Folder-level map — drill into a folder when a task touches it; the non-obvious gotchas are called out inline.

**Current surface:** the **Agents page** (`app/dashboard/agents`, was `test`) is the active product — Connect X → configure agent (handles + prompts) → **Run Agent** (single Grok call: scan + draft together, one cost) → every story is drafted → review + edit → **post manually per item**. Running without saving is an in-memory **preview**; **Save Agent** persists the config. The legacy `workflows` module (pages + the 4 legacy tables) was removed 2026-05-31; `monitors/scans/stories/drafts/posts` were dropped in the agents-model cutover. Live DB tables: `agents, runs, run_items, x_connections`. Auto-scan cron deferred. Full architecture + typing decisions: `docs/decisions/0002-agent-data-model.md`; original baseline: `docs/decisions/0001-architecture.md`.

# Agentic Context

- This project is developed interchangeably in **Claude Code** and **Codex**. `AGENTS.md` is the canonical shared instruction file read by both tools. Hence you are only allowed to always edit this `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` and contains further Claude Code-specific instructions if needed. User always edits that manually
- Whenever user asks you to check a webpage component on the frontend website, NEVER be confused on the credentials and always apply these as default unless specified otherwise: **Email:** `testuser@oparax.com`, **Password:** `hello123`.
