  Resolve residual Biome lint findings on a feature branch's changed files — the
  rules `biome check --write` can't safely auto-fix. Invoked by /feature-qc as its
  final pass; also runnable standalone on a branch (/feature-lint). NOT for
  formatting — the PostToolUse hook already does that on every write.

# Lint resolve — clear the residual, safely

The safe pass is already done. The `PostToolUse(Edit|Write)` hook
(`.claude/hooks/biome-write.sh`) runs `biome check --write` on every file the moment it's
written — formatting, import order, and every lint rule with a **safe** fix — so code is
never unformatted for longer than one tool call, in this session or any sub-agent's.

What reaches this skill is only the residual: rules with **no fix** (most `next` rules,
e.g. `noImgElement`) or an **unsafe** fix (`react/useExhaustiveDependencies`) — the ones
`--write` deliberately won't touch without `--unsafe`. Those need a human-style edit. This
skill clears them on the feature's changed files **without bloating the main
conversation** — it fans the fixes out to isolated sub-agents and returns a compact report.

## Correctness is the constraint

**Correctness is priority one.** The only automated safety net here is `pnpm build`
(TypeScript + Next compile) — there is no test runner and browser checks are out. A fix
that compiles can still change behavior. That single fact drives the design: fixes are
**risk-tiered**, and the dangerous tier is escalated to a higher-effort pass **and flagged
for review** rather than shipped silently.

## Sequence

1. **Scope to the feature diff.** Base defaults to `dev` (or `$ARGUMENTS`). Exclude
   deletions so Biome isn't handed missing paths:
   ```bash
   base="${ARGUMENTS:-dev}"
   files=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR "$base...HEAD" \
     -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.js' '*.jsx' '*.mjs' '*.cjs')
   ```
   Empty → nothing to do; stop.

2. **Extract the residual as JSON** (write to the session scratch dir, not the repo):
   ```bash
   echo "$files" | xargs pnpm exec biome lint --reporter=json --no-errors-on-unmatched > <scratch>/residual.json
   ```
   Parse it into `{ file → [findings] }`. Each finding carries a rule id (e.g.
   `lint/correctness/useExhaustiveDependencies`), a location, and a message.

3. **Risk-tier every finding by what its fix can break** — tier by *category*, not a
   frozen rule list, so new rules slot in by principle:
   - **High — behavior-changing.** The fix alters runtime semantics: effect/callback
     timing, re-render behavior, control flow. Anchor case
     `react/useExhaustiveDependencies` (editing a hook's dependency array changes when it
     fires — or loops). **`pnpm build` cannot catch a regression here.**
   - **Low/medium — mechanical or layout.** Adding an a11y attribute, a list `key`, or
     swapping `<img>`→`next/image` (needs real `width`/`height`; can shift layout, but the
     failure is visible/compile-checked, not silent).

4. **Inline vs. fan-out.** If the residual is tiny (≈≤3 findings across ≤2 files), just
   fix it inline — dispatch overhead isn't worth it. Otherwise **partition by file** (each
   file is owned by exactly one sub-agent — never two agents in the same file) and dispatch
   in parallel:
   - **Every tier → `lint-fixer`**, many in parallel. The one agent handles both kinds:
     mechanical fixes directly, behavior-changing fixes with care **and a ⚠ REVIEW flag**.
   Give each sub-agent only its file(s), that file's findings, and each finding's risk
   tier. The agent definition already carries the rules (no `--unsafe`, stay
   in-assignment, don't build); don't restate them — just pass the work.

5. **Gate.** After the sub-agents converge:
   ```bash
   pnpm build   # the only authority
   ```
   Their edits are already formatted — `lint-fixer` writes via the Edit tool, so the
   hook fired on each one. A clean `pnpm build` is the completion gate. If it fails, the
   error names the file — fix and re-run build.

6. **Report.** Return a compact summary: findings resolved per file, anything still
   unresolved, and a prominent **⚠ Review these** section collecting every high-tier
   behavior-changing fix the careful lane flagged. Surface that section to the user — those
   are the changes `pnpm build` can't vouch for.

## Notes
- Scope is **changed files only** — never fix pre-existing findings in untouched code.
  That's scope creep; surface them to the user instead of fixing them here.
- The safe pass is **not** this skill's job — the `PostToolUse` hook owns it, continuously.
  Never re-run `biome check --write` in bulk here; that would put formatting churn back
  into the QC diff, which is exactly what moving it to the hook removed.
- This is the single place `pnpm build` runs in the feature workflow.
